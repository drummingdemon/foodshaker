#FoodShaker
#### A Cross-Platform Random Food Generator


## What is this?
FoodShaker is a cross-platform mobile app written in HTML/JavaScript using PhoneGap. It stores the ingredients you have in your fridge and by shaking your device it will throw a random suggestion on what to cook based on what you have at home, taking into consideration the amount of time you've devoted to prepare a dish.

## What for?
It's my Final Project for Harvard University's CS50 Online Class in 2015. For the showcase video, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkRez6t34V8

## Thoughts?
This repository is for educational purposes only and frankly, it holds some leftover ideas from earlier stages of development meaning that it isn't cleaned up or it isn't in any way ready for code review. The reason it exists is the fact that I wanted to try out git in cli so I could continue to work on the project from various places.

It isn't pretty nor it is polished, but it holds the result of a learning process that involved constant trial and error. I do really hope other people will find something interesting for themselves in it or perhaps someone will find what he/she has been looking for. This is also my contribution back to the community, from whom I've learned a lot.
